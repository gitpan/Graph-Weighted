Revision history for Graph::Weighted

0.01  Tue Jun 17 11:08:36 2003
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
        -A -X -n Graph::WeightedNet

0.01.1  Sun Jun 29
    - Fixed documentation.

0.02  Sun Jun 29
    - Removed the unneccessary "reset_graph" method.
    - Added the forgotten "edgeless vertex" condition to the load(LoL)
      method.
    - Fixed the "edgeless vertex" condition semantics in the HoH and 
      LoL load method cases.
    - Fixed test messages.
    - Fixed the text of this file.
    - Added better test conditions for the "zero_edges" flag setting.
    - Handled Math::MatrixReal objects in the load method.

0.03  Sun Jun 29
    - Fixed the README.
    - Fixed and enhanced the documentation.
    - Refactored the test script, big time.
    - Added a conditional test for Math::MatrixReal.
    - Renamed the "matrix" accessor to "data", since a HoH is not
      really a matrix.

0.04  Mon Jun 30
    - Changed the variables called "neighbor(s)" to "successor(s)",
      because what I was thinking of as neighbors were actually
      successors.
    - Made the load method handle Math::Matrix and Math::MatrixBool
      objects (without requiring that the modules be loaded).
    - Added conditional tests for these, of course.
    - Updated documentation, appropriately.

0.05  Wed Jul 2
    - Changed a * to a + in the load from MatrixBool RE.
    - Added the min and max _weight methods.
    - Updated documentation and test suite, accordingly.

0.05.1  Wed Jul 2
    - Removed the unneccessary graph_weight computation in the
      constructor.
    - Fixed innocuous documentation typo.

0.06  Thu Jul 3
    - Added initialization for the heaviest and lightest vertex lists.

0.07  Fri Jul 4
    - Added tests for empty data references.
    - Added croaks for undefined vertices in the vertex_ and 
      edge_weight methods.

0.08  Fri Jul 11 2003
    - Enhanced the documentation.
